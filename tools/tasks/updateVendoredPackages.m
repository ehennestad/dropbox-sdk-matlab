function updateVendoredPackages()
% updateVendoredPackages - Replace the vendored packages with the versions pinned here
%
%   updateVendoredPackages() downloads each package listed below from
%   GitHub and replaces its copy in code/external, where the package is
%   part of the namespace dropbox.external. The commit that was copied is
%   recorded in the vendorinfo.json file of the copy.
%
%   The copies are replaced as a whole and are not edited by hand. A
%   change to a vendored package is made in its own repository and
%   brought in by running this function again.
